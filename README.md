# Financial Advice Platform

## Overview

This platform is a multi-channel financial advice application built to provide Australian users with personalized insights about their superannuation and retirement planning. The system leverages AI to analyze user information, compare super funds, project retirement balances, and calculate retirement outcomes.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Python Backend**: Powers the financial analysis logic and chat processing
- **Supabase Database**: Stores user profiles, chat history, and financial data
- **Gradio Web UI**: Provides a simple, web-based chat interface
- **Multi-channel Integrations**: Support for various messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook)
- **Advisor Workstation**: Separate application for financial advisors to manage client relationships

### Data Flow

1. Users interact with the system via web chat or messaging platforms
2. The chat backend processes queries using OpenAI's GPT models
3. User data and interactions are stored in Supabase
4. Financial calculations are performed with the Python backend
5. Advisors can access client data through the advisor workstation

## Technical Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Frontend**: Gradio for web interface
- **Deployment**: Render for hosting
- **Database Migrations**: Node.js scripts
